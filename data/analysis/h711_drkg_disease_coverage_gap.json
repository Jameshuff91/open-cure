    "key_insight": "The DRKG disease coverage gap is SMALL (4.8% diseases, 1.5% GT pairs). The REAL data gap is in EC disease name\u2192MESH ID matching: 56.9% of EC disease names fail to map, losing 50.9% of EC drug-disease pairs from internal GT. Most unmapped names are SYNONYMS of already-mapped diseases (e.g. 'migraine' vs 'migraine disorders', 'emphysema' vs 'pulmonary emphysema'). Better name matching could potentially double internal GT."
