  "findings": "\nSuccessfully generated human-readable explanation templates for each confidence tier.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n1. Map disease category \u2192 tier (TIER1/2/3)\n2. Select explanation template based on tier\n3. Fill in disease name, category, and metrics\n4. Output includes both qualitative explanation and quantitative metrics\n\nVALUE:\n- Helps users understand WHY a prediction is trusted\n- Provides actionable guidance (validate/explore/avoid)\n- Increases transparency and appropriate use of predictions\n"
