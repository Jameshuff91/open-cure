h489: Mechanism-Required ATC Coherent for Psychiatric/Respiratory
======================================================================
Date: 2026-02-06
Status: INVALIDATED

HYPOTHESIS: h487 found psychiatric ATC coherent: 35.1% holdout WITH mechanism,
0% WITHOUT. Respiratory: 38.9% with mechanism, 6.7% without. Test requiring
mechanism_support for these ATC coherent categories.

======================================================================
FULL-DATA ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Total predictions: 13,622

Psychiatric ATC coherent:
  With mechanism: 50 (27/50 GT = 54.0%)
  Without mechanism: 13 (6/13 GT = 46.2%)

Respiratory ATC coherent:
  With mechanism: 2 (0/2 GT = 0.0%)
  Without mechanism: 40 (1/40 GT = 2.5%)

Psychiatric WITHOUT mechanism predictions:
  [GT] Paroxetine → major depressive disorder (freq=4) [FDA APPROVED]
  [GT] Sertraline → major depressive disorder (freq=3) [FDA APPROVED]
  [  ] Venlafaxine → social anxiety disorder (freq=3) [FDA APPROVED - GT GAP]
  [GT] Sertraline → social anxiety disorder (freq=3) [FDA APPROVED]
  [GT] Diazepam → acute alcohol withdrawal (freq=5) [STANDARD OF CARE]
  [  ] Paroxetine → acute alcohol withdrawal (freq=4) [Off-label]
  [GT] Phenobarbital → acute alcohol withdrawal (freq=7) [STANDARD OF CARE]
  [  ] Paroxetine → bulimia nervosa (freq=4) [Off-label SSRI]
  [  ] Venlafaxine → bulimia nervosa (freq=3) [Off-label]
  [GT] Sertraline → bulimia nervosa (freq=3)
  [  ] Diazepam → bulimia nervosa (freq=5) [Not indicated]
  [  ] Phenobarbital → bulimia nervosa (freq=7) [Not indicated]
  [  ] Diazepam → obsessive compulsive disorder (freq=5) [Not indicated]

Clinical assessment: 6/13 (46%) are FDA-approved or standard-of-care uses.
At least 2 more are well-known off-label uses.

Split                       n/seed    Holdout      Std
-------------------------------------------------------
psych_mech                     8.4      50.4%    10.2%   [RELIABLE]
psych_nomech                   2.4      10.0%    20.0%   [UNRELIABLE, n<5]
resp_mech                      2.8      22.7%    31.4%   [UNRELIABLE, n<5]
resp_nomech                    4.0       2.5%     5.0%   [BORDERLINE]

MEDIUM precision impact:
  Baseline: 24.6% ± 2.9%
  Simulated (with demotion): 24.8% ± 2.8%
  Delta: +0.2pp (negligible)

======================================================================
COMPARISON WITH h487 RESULTS
======================================================================

h487 reported (from earlier session):
  psychiatric_mech: n=5.6/seed, 35.1% holdout
  psychiatric_nomech: n=1.3/seed, 0.0% holdout ← ARTIFACT of small n!

Our replication:
  psychiatric_mech: n=8.4/seed, 50.4% holdout (higher n, different prediction set)
  psychiatric_nomech: n=2.4/seed, 10.0% holdout (NOT zero - still unreliable)

Discrepancy likely due to different seed set or code changes between sessions.
Key finding: psychiatric_nomech 0% was an artifact of n=1.3/seed.
With slightly more data (n=2.4), it becomes 10% - still unreliable but not zero.

======================================================================
DECISION: INVALIDATED
======================================================================

1. PSYCHIATRIC nomech demotion: REJECTED
   - Holdout n=2.4/seed (UNRELIABLE per memory note #26)
   - 46.2% full-data GT rate (6/13 are known FDA-approved uses)
   - Demoting would remove clinically correct predictions
   - h487's 0% was a small-n artifact

2. RESPIRATORY nomech demotion: NOT WORTH IT
   - Impact: +0.1pp MEDIUM holdout (negligible)
   - Would demote 40 predictions including plausible GT gaps
     (fluticasone→allergic rhinitis = FDA-approved but not in GT)

3. COMBINED impact: +0.2pp MEDIUM holdout (not worth the clinical false positives)

KEY LEARNING:
- The h487 mechanism split data was based on sub-threshold n sizes
- 0% holdout from n=1.3/seed has p(artifact) = ~8.8% - not uncommon
- Full-data GT rate is a better signal than unreliable holdout for n<5
- Confirms memory note #26: DO NOT make demotion decisions from n<5/seed
