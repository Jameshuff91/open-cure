  "conclusion": "h168 VALIDATED: Neurological low precision (26.1%) is due to FUNDAMENTAL kNN limitations.\n    \nNeurological diseases cluster with 'other' category in embedding space (92% of neighbors).\nThis means kNN recommendations come from non-neurological diseases which don't have neurological drugs.\nDrug class rescue (like h144 statins) is not feasible because neurological drugs have:\n- Low training frequency (most freq=1-4)\n- Cross-category usage (anticonvulsants for psychiatric, pain)\n\nThis is NOT a model bug but a DATA STRUCTURE issue. The only solutions require either:\n1. Modifying the kNN algorithm (category-weighted similarity)\n2. External data injection (explicit neurological drug catalogs)\n3. Accepting lower precision for this category"
