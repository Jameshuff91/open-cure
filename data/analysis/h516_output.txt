h516: Expand SOC Drug Class Mappings - INVALIDATED

All 7 proposed expansions have 0% precision:
  tetracyclines → infectious/dermatological: 0/248 = 0%
  macrolides → infectious/respiratory: 0/129 = 0%
  cephalosporins → infectious: 0/119 = 0%
  antifungals → infectious: 0/116 = 0%
  local_anesthetics → dermatological/ophthalmic: 0/38 = 0%
  corticotropin → autoimmune/neuro/derm/opth: 0/37 = 0%
  methotrexate → cancer: 0/36 = 0%

INSIGHT: Current 17 SOC classes are well-calibrated. These drugs ARE used
in their predicted categories but kNN doesn't predict them for specific
diseases where they have GT entries. The SOC classification captures
GT gaps in BROAD drug classes (corticosteroids, statins) that work 
across many diseases in a category, NOT drug-disease-specific matches.
