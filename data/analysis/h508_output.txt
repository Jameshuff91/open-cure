h508: Self-Referential Disease Characterization

FINDING 1: GT Size is the DOMINANT Predictor
- 79.2% of self-ref diseases have GT ≤ 2
- Odds ratio: 8.6x (GT ≤ 2 predicts self-ref)
- GT=1: 59.6% are self-ref; GT=2: 41.4%; GT>5: 7.6%

FINDING 2: Category Modulates Self-Ref Rate (controlling for GT ≤ 2)
- HIGH: GI 89%, immunological 100%, hematological 77%, renal 83%
- LOW: infectious 35%, autoimmune 33%, dermatological 20%
- GI/immuno/heme have UNIQUE drug profiles; autoimmune/infectious share drugs

FINDING 3: 11 'Therapeutic Island' Diseases (GT>5, 100% self-ref)
- Immunodeficiency (34 drugs), PAH (26), CKD (19), HepC (11), Opioid constipation (11)
- ADHD (7), DKA (8), Obesity (8), Migraine w/ aura (9), Dacryocystitis (6), Aplastic anemia (6)
- Each has a DEDICATED drug class with no cross-indication use

FINDING 4: Mechanism-Specific Overlap is Minimal
- Only 6/144 (4.2%) self-ref overlap with mechanism-specific
- Different phenomena: mech-specific=drug specificity, self-ref=embedding isolation

CONCLUSION: Two distinct causes:
1. SMALL GT (79%): statistical (few drugs → no sharing possible)
2. THERAPEUTIC ISLANDS (8%): genuine uniqueness (dedicated drug classes)
3. RESIDUAL (13%): medium GT with partial uniqueness

ACTIONABILITY: Not actionable for tier demotion. Informative for deliverable annotation.
