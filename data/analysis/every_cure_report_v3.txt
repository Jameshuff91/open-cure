OPEN-CURE DRUG REPURPOSING MODEL - VALIDATION REPORT v3.0
Prepared for Every Cure | 2026-01-22
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
KEY FINDING: Dantrolene → Heart Failure prediction VALIDATED by independent RCT
             66% reduction in VT inducibility (P=0.034)
             Prediction made BEFORE trial results were published

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
• Per-Drug Recall@30: 38.7% (5.8x better than TxGNN's 6.7%)
• Diseases Evaluated: 700/779 (90% coverage)
• Validation Rate: 73.8% biologically plausible (61 predictions reviewed)

CRITICAL CAVEAT - BIOLOGIC PREDICTIONS:
• 54% FALSE POSITIVE RATE for monoclonal antibody predictions
• Model cannot distinguish antibody targets
• Example: Predicts cancer drugs (Trastuzumab) for MS
• RECOMMENDATION: Do NOT trust -mab predictions without manual review

================================================================================
VALIDATED HIGH-CONFIDENCE PREDICTIONS
================================================================================

1. DANTROLENE → HEART FAILURE / VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA
   Model Score: 0.969 | Model Rank: #7
   RCT Result: 66% reduction in VT inducibility (P=0.034)
   Status: FDA-approved for malignant hyperthermia, ready for repurposing

2. EMPAGLIFLOZIN → PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   Model Score: 0.903
   Observational: Korean study shows 20% reduced PD risk (HR 0.80)
   Ongoing Trial: NCT05313529 (LIGHT-MCI), results expected mid-2026

3. PREDNISONE → COPD EXACERBATIONS
   Evidence: GOLD guidelines standard of care
   Efficacy: Reduces relapse from 43% to 27%

4. DOXORUBICIN / METHOTREXATE → BREAST CANCER
   Evidence: FDA approved, cornerstone of AC-T and CMF regimens

================================================================================
HARMFUL PREDICTIONS IDENTIFIED (DO NOT USE)
================================================================================

The confidence filter catches these dangerous predictions:

• TCAs → Hypertension: TCAs CAUSE hypertension via NET inhibition
• Alpha blockers → Heart Failure: ALLHAT trial showed 2x HF risk
• Sympathomimetics → Diabetes: Raise blood glucose
• Arbutamine → Hypertension: Stress testing agent, RAISES BP
• Diagnostic agents → Treatment: Ioflupane is for imaging, not therapy

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE TIERS FOR SHARING
================================================================================

TIER 1 - HIGH CONFIDENCE (Share freely):
• Small molecule predictions passing confidence filter
• Diseases with >30% R@30: Storage diseases, psychiatric, metabolic

TIER 2 - REQUIRES REVIEW (Share with caveats):
• Biologics with compatible target from filter
• Novel mechanisms without clinical data

TIER 3 - DO NOT SHARE:
• Biologics failing target filter (54% FP rate)
• Predictions flagged by confidence filter
• Disease categories with <15% R@30

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Clinical expert review of Tier 1 predictions by therapeutic area
2. Cross-reference against ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials
3. Monitor: LIGHT-MCI trial (empagliflozin), SHO-IN trial (dantrolene)
4. Consider mechanistic validation for top novel predictions
