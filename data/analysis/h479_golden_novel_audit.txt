h479: Uncertain GOLDEN Novel Demotion
======================================================================
Date: 2026-02-06
Status: VALIDATED (1 harmful found, 4 false positives documented)

HYPOTHESIS: h473 identified 8 GOLDEN novel predictions with no/weak clinical
evidence. Investigate whether any have hidden clinical support and handle
false positives.

======================================================================
FINDINGS
======================================================================

Of the original 8 uncertain predictions:
- 2 already moved to FILTER by recent changes (phentermine, quinaprilat → FH)
- 6 still at GOLDEN

Literature validation of 6 remaining:

| Drug | Disease | Evidence | Action |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Semaglutide | Familial hypercholesterolemia | PROMISING | KEEP (lipid-lowering evidence) |
| Minocycline | Urticaria | HARMFUL (CAUSES it) | → INVERSE_INDICATION_PAIRS |
| Lidocaine | Keratosis pilaris | NO_EVIDENCE | Document as false positive |
| Levofloxacin | Glaucoma | NO_EVIDENCE | Document as false positive |
| Lidocaine | ADHD | NO_EVIDENCE | Document as false positive |
| Lidocaine | Retinitis | NO_EVIDENCE | Document as false positive |

Summary: 1/6 promising (17%), 1/6 harmful (17%), 4/6 false positives (67%)

======================================================================
MINOCYCLINE → URTICARIA: INVERSE INDICATION
======================================================================

Added to INVERSE_INDICATION_PAIRS.
Evidence: Case reports document acute severe urticaria developing 3-28 days
after minocycline initiation. Can recur >12 months after discontinuation.
(MDedge, Cureus case reports)

Impact: GOLDEN 283 predictions, 64.7% full-data precision (+0.6pp)

======================================================================
FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS
======================================================================

The 4 no-evidence predictions share a pattern:
- ALL from "standard" GOLDEN rule (disease_tier=1, freq≥10, mechanism_support)
- Lidocaine has freq=43 (highest in GOLDEN, treats many conditions)
- The standard rule doesn't validate disease-specific relevance

34% of GOLDEN predictions (97/285) come from the "standard" rule.
These are higher risk for false positives than hierarchy rules.

However, many standard-rule GOLDEN are correct:
- Lidocaine → neuropathy (FDA-approved)
- Lidocaine → diabetic neuropathy (FDA-approved)
- Lidocaine → atopic dermatitis (used for itch)
- Minocycline → rosacea (FDA-approved as Oracea)

DECISION: Do NOT add specific exclusions for the 4 false positives.
- GOLDEN claims ~62% holdout precision → ~38% expected false positives
- Individual case exclusions = overfitting
- The false positive rate is within expected bounds
- Would need a systematic approach (e.g., "standard" rule holdout audit) to improve
