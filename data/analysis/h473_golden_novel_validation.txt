-- ----  -----------------------  ----------------------------------------  ---------------  ----------    ----------------------------------------
1  R1    Methylprednisolone       Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)          dermatological   GT_GAP        IV methylprednisolone pulse = first-line in Japan. 0% mortality for SJS, 7% for TEN. Controversial in West but multiple studies show benefit.
2  R1    Prednisolone             GVHD                                     autoimmune       GT_GAP        Prednisone/prednisolone IS first-line for acute GVHD (ASBMT guidelines). 2mg/kg/day standard. Clear GT gap.
3  R1    Dexamethasone            Hidradenitis suppurativa                  dermatological   PROMISING     Corticosteroids used for acute flares and as bridge therapy. Low-dose systemic corticosteroids as adjunct. Not first-line monotherapy.
4  R1    Methylprednisolone       Myasthenia gravis                        autoimmune       GT_GAP        High-dose IV methylprednisolone is established treatment. Faster improvement than oral. Cochrane review supports corticosteroids for MG.
5  R3    Hydrocortisone           Pyoderma gangrenosum                     autoimmune       GT_GAP        Corticosteroids ARE first-line immunosuppressant for PG worldwide (STOP GAP trial). Prednisolone specifically studied, hydrocortisone same class.
6  R3    Hydrocortisone           Scleroderma                              autoimmune       WEAK          Controversial. 41% of SSc patients receive corticosteroids, but HIGH RISK of scleroderma renal crisis. Should be low-dose only in early inflammatory disease.
7  R2    Prednisolone             Eosinophilic granulomatosis w/ polyangiitis  autoimmune   GT_GAP        Corticosteroids ARE the cornerstone of EGPA therapy. Prednisone 40-60mg/day first-line. Clear GT gap.
8  R4    Dexamethasone            Autoimmune hepatitis                     autoimmune       PROMISING     Corticosteroids are cornerstone of AIH treatment (80-90% remission). Prednisone/prednisolone are standard; dexamethasone less commonly used but same mechanism.
9  R1    Lovastatin               Familial hypercholesterolemia            metabolic        GT_GAP        Lovastatin FDA-approved for heterozygous FH (10-40mg/day). First statin ever approved. Clear GT gap.
10 R2    Rosuvastatin             Familial hypercholesterolemia            metabolic        GT_GAP        Rosuvastatin FDA-approved for homozygous AND heterozygous FH. Starting dose 20mg for HoFH. Clear GT gap.
11 R3    Niacin                   Familial hypercholesterolemia            metabolic        PROMISING     Niacin normalizes LDL in combo with statin/resin for HeFH. But AIM-HIGH/HPS2-THRIVE showed no CV benefit. Now last-line option.
12 R2    Lovastatin               Atherosclerosis                          cardiovascular   GT_GAP        AFCAPS/TexCAPS: 37% reduction in cardiac events. ACAPS: slowed/reversed carotid atherosclerosis. FDA-approved for CVD prevention.
13 R4    Gemfibrozil              Hypercholesterolemia                     metabolic        GT_GAP        FDA-approved for type IIb hypercholesterolemia (1981). Helsinki Heart Study: 34% relative reduction in coronary events. Second-line to statins.
14 R1    Clopidogrel              Coronary artery disease                  cardiovascular   GT_GAP        FDA-approved for ACS (unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI) and secondary prevention. Standard of care for PCI/stenting. Clear GT gap.
15 R1    Lidocaine                Diabetic neuropathy                      neurological     PROMISING     5% lidocaine plaster: comparable to pregabalin/gabapentin for DPN pain. IV lidocaine: 51% pain reduction in RCT. Not disease-modifying but symptomatic treatment.
16 R1    Lidocaine                Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy  neurological  NO_EVIDENCE  No specific evidence found. Disease-modifying treatments are gene silencers (patisiran, inotersen) and TTR stabilizers (tafamidis). Lidocaine would only address pain symptom.
17 R4    Tetracycline             Lyme disease (erythema migrans)          dermatological   GT_GAP        Doxycycline (a tetracycline) IS first-line for Lyme/EM. Tetracycline equally effective but requires more frequent dosing. IDSA/AAN/ACR guidelines.
18 R3    Hydrocortisone           Vernal keratoconjunctivitis              ophthalmic       GT_GAP        Hydrocortisone IS recommended first-line low-absorption corticosteroid for VKC. Used in pulsed 3-5 day regimens for acute flares.
19 R2    Dexamethasone            Urticaria                                dermatological   WEAK          RCT found IV dexamethasone did NOT improve acute urticaria. Prednisolone 50mg preferred when steroid needed. Dexamethasone specifically not recommended.
20 R4    Dexamethasone            Pruritus                                 dermatological   WEAK          Very uncertain evidence for corticosteroids treating itch. IV dexamethasone can CAUSE perineal pruritus. Not a standard treatment.

SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Total validated: 20

Category breakdown:
  GT_GAP       : 11 (55%)  - Drug already used for disease, missing from ground truth
  PROMISING    :  4 (20%)  - Clinical evidence exists, not yet standard of care
  WEAK         :  3 (15%)  - Limited/uncertain evidence
  NO_EVIDENCE  :  1 ( 5%)  - No evidence for this specific pair
  HARMFUL      :  0 ( 0%)  - None harmful

Combined GT_GAP + PROMISING = 15/20 (75%) have clinical support
Combined WEAK + NO_EVIDENCE = 4/20 (20%) lack strong evidence
Harmful = 0/20 (0%)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. **75% of GOLDEN novel predictions have clinical literature support.**
   - 55% are GT gaps (drug IS used but missing from Every Cure ground truth)
   - 20% have promising clinical evidence (trials, case reports)

2. **GT gaps are concentrated in well-known drug classes:**
   - Corticosteroids: methylprednisolone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone
     for autoimmune/inflammatory diseases = ALL GT gaps (steroids are ubiquitous)
   - Statins: lovastatin, rosuvastatin for FH = FDA-approved indications (obvious GT gaps)
   - Clopidogrel for CAD = FDA-approved (obvious GT gap)
   - Tetracycline for Lyme = first-line (doxycycline is a tetracycline)
   - Gemfibrozil for hypercholesterolemia = FDA-approved

3. **The 3 weak/no-evidence predictions share a pattern:**
   - Dexamethasone→urticaria: RCT showed NO benefit (dex not recommended)
   - Dexamethasone→pruritus: limited evidence, may cause pruritus
   - Hydrocortisone→scleroderma: controversial, risk of renal crisis
   - Lidocaine→TTR polyneuropathy: symptomatic pain treatment only, no evidence

4. **GT gap rate (55%) suggests ground truth incompleteness is a major issue.**
   The Every Cure GT is missing many standard-of-care drug-disease pairs.

5. **Corticosteroid dominance:** 10/20 top GOLDEN novels are corticosteroids.
   Steroids treat essentially ALL inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, making them
   "universal" predictions. This inflates apparent novelty.

6. **GOLDEN precision estimate from literature:**
   If we define "correct" as GT_GAP + PROMISING: 75% ± unknown
   This is HIGHER than holdout-estimated 62.7%, suggesting holdout is conservative
   (holdout only catches GT gaps if the GT-gap drug exists in the GT for related diseases).

================================================================================
IMPLICATIONS FOR DELIVERABLE
================================================================================

1. GOLDEN novel predictions are HIGH VALUE - 75% have clinical support
2. Consider adding a "literature_validation" column for curated predictions
3. Ground truth should be expanded to include corticosteroid indications
4. Statin/lipid drug GT is clearly incomplete for FH/atherosclerosis
5. The 3 weak predictions could be flagged or demoted
6. Lidocaine→polyneuropathy is a symptomatic (pain) prediction, not disease-modifying

================================================================================
EXTRAPOLATION TO ALL 104 GOLDEN NOVELS (by drug class analysis)
================================================================================

Based on validated patterns from the top 20 and drug class knowledge:

  Likely GT Gap:  82 (78.8%)  - Drug class IS standard-of-care for disease class
  Promising:      14 (13.5%)  - Clinical evidence exists (adalimumab→autoimmune, SGLT2i→CV, etc.)
  Uncertain/Weak:  8 ( 7.7%)  - Limited evidence (lidocaine→ADHD, levofloxacin→glaucoma, etc.)

  GT Gap + Promising: 96 / 104 = 92.3%

Drug class breakdown of the 82 likely GT gaps:
  - Corticosteroids: 38 (steroids for inflammatory/autoimmune diseases)
  - Lipid drugs: 28 (statins, bile acid sequestrants, PCSK9i for FH/dyslipidemia)
  - Other established: 16 (azathioprine, methotrexate, antithyroid, carvedilol, etc.)

The 8 uncertain predictions:
  - Lidocaine → ADHD, retinitis, keratosis pilaris (no evidence for these)
  - Levofloxacin → glaucoma (no evidence)
  - Phentermine → FH (questionable)
  - Semaglutide → FH, Quinaprilat → FH (indirect at best)
  - Minocycline → urticaria (unusual)

================================================================================
CORTICOSTEROID GT GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The majority of corticosteroid GOLDEN novels are GT gaps because:
- Every Cure GT uses specific drug-disease mappings
- Corticosteroids treat broad disease categories (all autoimmune, all inflammatory)
- Individual steroid variants (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, etc.)
  may not all be listed for every specific disease in the GT
- This is a known limitation of disease-specific GT databases

Recommendation: Consider adding a "corticosteroid_gt_expansion" step to fill
known gaps for anti-inflammatory diseases.
