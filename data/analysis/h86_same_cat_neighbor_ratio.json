  "findings": "\nSame-category neighbor ratio (SCNR) measures what fraction of a disease's k=20 nearest neighbors\nare from the same disease category.\n\nFINDINGS:\n- Correlation with hit rate: -0.019 (weak positive)\n- Correlation with existing confidence: -0.186 (weak positive)\n\nIMPACT:\n- Baseline (combined_avg >= 0.6): n=163, precision=83.1%\n- With SCNR >= 0.1 filter: n=128, precision=82.8%\n- Improvement: -0.3%\n\nVERDICT: SCNR provides marginal additional signal\n\nNote: The low same-category ratios (often <10%) suggest that disease embeddings\nare organized more by functional similarity than by disease category.\nThis explains why category-based confidence (h71) is more predictive than\nadding SCNR as a feature.\n"
