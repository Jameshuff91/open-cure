h509: CV Coronary Hierarchy Demotion - INVALIDATED (DO NOT DEMOTE)
==================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Should coronary hierarchy be demoted HIGH→MEDIUM based on h506's 35.1% holdout?

ANALYSIS:
- Coronary group: 5 diseases (MI, CAD, stable angina, unstable angina, ACS)
- Only 2 generate hierarchy predictions: CAD (75%) and ACS (50%)
- Expected holdout diseases per seed: 1.0 (n too small!)
- Per-seed holdout: Seed 42=33.3% (ACS only), Seeds 123/456/789=0/0, Seed 2024=0/1
- Mean holdout: 6.7% ± 13.3% (dominated by 3 empty seeds)

FULL-DATA PRECISION: 65.6% (21/32) — WELL ABOVE MEDIUM average
  - CAD: 15/20 = 75%
  - ACS: 6/12 = 50%

DECISION: DO NOT DEMOTE. Reasons:
1. n≈1/seed → holdout unreliable (h494: min n≈30 for reliable holdout)
2. Full-data 65.6% consistent with HIGH tier
3. Encodes genuine medical knowledge (statins, antiplatelets, beta-blockers)
4. Same conclusion as h432 (small rules = high precision) and h494 (min-n)

Also confirmed: ALL CV hierarchy groups suffer from small-n:
  - Arrhythmia: 3 diseases, 93.2% full-data
  - Hypertension: 4 diseases, 86.5% full-data
  - Coronary: 5 diseases, 65.6% full-data
  - Atherosclerosis: 2 diseases, 83.3% full-data
  - Heart failure: 2 diseases, 50.0% full-data

None should be demoted — the holdout for ALL is unreliable.


EXTENDED ANALYSIS: HIGH Tier Per-Rule Holdout Breakdown
=======================================================

Underperforming HIGH rules (holdout < 35%):
- metabolic_hierarchy_diabetes: 20.8% ± 25.9% (n=29, 5 seeds) - CANDIDATE for demotion
- cardiovascular: 25.0% ± 22.4% (n=14, 5 seeds) - TOO SMALL
- metabolic_hierarchy_thyroid: 26.4% ± 10.5% (n=16, 3 seeds) - borderline
- cardiovascular_hierarchy_hypertension: 27.8% ± 20.8% (n=12, 3 seeds) - TOO SMALL
- cardiovascular_hierarchy_coronary: 16.7% ± 16.7% (n=13, 2 seeds) - TOO SMALL
- respiratory: 31.2% ± 20.7% (n=20, 4 seeds) - MARGINAL

Well-performing HIGH rules:
- autoimmune_hierarchy_colitis: 83.3% (n=24)
- infectious_hierarchy_tuberculosis: 72.7% (n=11)
- cardiovascular_hierarchy_arrhythmia: 73.3% (n=15)
- autoimmune_hierarchy_rheumatoid_arthritis: 68.3% (n=41)
- incoherent_demotion: 64.0% (n=25)
- default: 54.3% (n=94)

DIABETES HIERARCHY ANALYSIS:
- 14 diseases total, core diseases (T1D, T2D, DM) have 83-100% full-data
- But complications (DKA, nephropathy, retinopathy) have tiny GT and don't generalize
- Holdout 20.8% likely driven by complications in holdout
- HIGH variance (25.9pp) from seed 2024 (43.8%) vs seeds 42/456/789 (0%)

THYROID HIERARCHY:
- Congenital hypothyroidism: 14% full-data (drags down)
- Hyperthyroidism: 33% full-data
- Holdout 26.4% ± 10.5%

DECISION: Do not demote either yet. Both have <30 predictions across 5 seeds.
The diabetes hierarchy COULD be a future target if we can separate core diabetes
from complications in the hierarchy. Create follow-up hypothesis.
