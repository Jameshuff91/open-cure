-- ----  -----------------------  ----------------------------------------  ----------------  ----------     ----------------------------------------
1  R1    Methylprednisolone       Polyarticular JIA                         autoimmune        GT_GAP         IV methylprednisolone pulse used for JIA. Intra-articular corticosteroids are first-line per ACR. Systemic for severe cases.
2  R1    Methylprednisolone       Crohn's disease                           autoimmune        GT_GAP         IV methylprednisolone 60mg/day is standard for severe Crohn's. Corticosteroids remain one of the most potent drugs to induce remission.
3  R1    Dexamethasone            Extrapulmonary TB                         infectious        GT_GAP         Adjunctive dexamethasone IMPROVES SURVIVAL in TB meningitis (NEJM). WHO recommends for CNS TB. Also used for miliary TB.
4  R1    Dexamethasone            Celiac disease                            gastrointestinal  PROMISING      Corticosteroids used for refractory celiac and celiac crisis. Not first-line (GFD is). Steroids comparable to GFD in studies.
5  R1    Erythromycin             Bacterial meningitis                      infectious        WEAK           Erythromycin NOT recommended for meningitis. Poor CNS penetration. Standard is 3rd-gen cephalosporins (ceftriaxone/cefotaxime).
6  R1    Ofloxacin                Sinusitis                                 respiratory       GT_GAP         Fluoroquinolones effective for sinusitis (94% cure rate). FDA-approved class. However, reserved for no-alternative patients due to safety.
7  R1    Minocycline              Peritonitis                               gastrointestinal  WEAK           Limited evidence for minocycline specifically in peritonitis. Other antibiotics preferred.
8  R1    Prednisone               Chronic IBD diarrhea                      gastrointestinal  GT_GAP         Prednisone IS first-line for inducing remission in moderate-severe IBD. Directly addresses inflammatory diarrhea.
9  R1    Dexamethasone            Stomatitis                                gastrointestinal  GT_GAP         Dexamethasone mouthwash IS standard treatment for oral stomatitis/mucositis. Well-established.
10 R1    Prednisone               Chronic kidney disease                    renal             PROMISING      Corticosteroids used for IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease. Not for CKD broadly - depends on underlying cause.
11 R1    Dexamethasone            Primary biliary cholangitis               gastrointestinal  WEAK           Limited evidence. Prednisolone trial showed better hepatic outcomes but budesonide preferred. Reserved for highly selected cases.
12 R1    Famotidine               Chronic peptic ulcer disease              gastrointestinal  GT_GAP         FDA-approved for duodenal and gastric ulcers. H2 blocker. Heals active ulcers. Clear GT gap.
13 R1    Bromocriptine            Dyskinesia                                neurological      PROMISING      Dopamine D2 agonist with some evidence for tardive dyskinesia but mixed results. Not first-line.
14 R1    Dexamethasone            Chronic pancreatitis                      gastrointestinal  WEAK           No strong evidence for corticosteroids in chronic pancreatitis. Used for autoimmune pancreatitis (type 1) which is different.
15 R2    Liothyronine             Congenital hypothyroidism                 metabolic         PROMISING      Liothyronine (T3) used as add-on to levothyroxine in selected cases with central resistance. Not first-line.
16 R2    Levothyroxine            Hyperthyroidism                           metabolic         HARMFUL        Levothyroxine is CONTRAINDICATED in hyperthyroidism. It treats HYPOthyroidism. Giving T4 to hyperthyroid patient is dangerous.
17 R2    Levofloxacin             Extrapulmonary TB                         infectious        PROMISING      Fluoroquinolones (including levofloxacin) are second-line TB drugs. WHO recommends for MDR-TB. Evidence for efficacy.
18 R2    Minocycline              Malaria                                   infectious        PROMISING      Tetracyclines active against Plasmodium. Historical evidence for minocycline-quinine combo. Doxycycline preferred in practice.
19 R2    Diazoxide                Hyperglycemia                             metabolic         HARMFUL        Diazoxide CAUSES hyperglycemia (inhibits insulin). Used for HYPOglycemia. This prediction is INVERSE.
20 R2    Betamethasone            Primary biliary cholangitis               gastrointestinal  WEAK           Same as dexamethasone (#11). Very limited evidence for corticosteroids in PBC.

KEY DIFFERENCES:
1. HIGH has FEWER GT gaps (35% vs 55%) - more diverse drug-disease pairs
2. HIGH has MORE promising (30% vs 20%) - more genuinely novel predictions
3. HIGH has 2 HARMFUL predictions (10%) vs 0 for GOLDEN - safety concern
4. Overall clinical support: HIGH (65%) < GOLDEN (75%) - expected from tier hierarchy

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. **Two HARMFUL predictions in HIGH tier:**
   - Levothyroxine → hyperthyroidism: INVERSE indication (treats hypothyroidism, contraindicated in hyper)
   - Diazoxide → hyperglycemia: CAUSES hyperglycemia (treats hypoglycemia)
   These represent a SAFETY CONCERN in the tier system.

2. **Root cause of harmful predictions:**
   Both are hierarchy rule matches: metabolic_hierarchy_thyroid and metabolic_hierarchy_diabetes.
   The hierarchy maps levothyroxine from hypothyroidism→hyperthyroidism (same organ, opposite condition)
   and diazoxide from hypoglycemia→hyperglycemia (opposite effect).
   **The hierarchy rules don't account for INVERSE drug-disease relationships.**

3. **HIGH tier is more diverse than GOLDEN:**
   - GI diseases prominent: celiac, PBC, stomatitis, pancreatitis, peritonitis
   - Infectious diseases: TB, meningitis, malaria, sinusitis
   - Metabolic: thyroid, diabetes
   - GOLDEN was dominated by autoimmune/dermatological

4. **Antibiotic predictions are mixed:**
   - Ofloxacin→sinusitis: GT gap (fluoroquinolones effective)
   - Levofloxacin→TB: promising (second-line TB drug)
   - Erythromycin→meningitis: weak (poor CNS penetration)
   - Minocycline→peritonitis: weak

5. **Corticosteroid predictions still prevalent but more uncertain:**
   - Dexamethasone→celiac: promising (refractory)
   - Dexamethasone→PBC: weak
   - Dexamethasone→pancreatitis: weak
   - Fewer obvious GT gaps than GOLDEN corticosteroids

================================================================================
ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. **URGENT: Add inverse-indication filter for thyroid and diabetes hierarchy rules**
   - Levothyroxine → hyperthyroidism is HARMFUL (currently HIGH tier!)
   - Diazoxide → hyperglycemia is HARMFUL (currently HIGH tier!)
   - Need to add these as FILTER exclusions

2. **Investigate all hierarchy rules for inverse-indication patterns:**
   - metabolic_hierarchy_thyroid: check all anti-thyroid → hypothyroidism and vice versa
   - metabolic_hierarchy_diabetes: check all insulin → hyperglycemia and vice versa
   - Could systematically check: if drug treats condition A, filter predictions for opposite of A

3. **Consider adding an "inverse_indication" safety filter:**
   - Drugs that treat hypothyroidism should be filtered from hyperthyroidism predictions
   - Drugs that treat hypoglycemia should be filtered from hyperglycemia predictions
   - This is a new class of error not caught by existing confidence filters

4. **HIGH tier literature support (65%) validates the system:**
   - Matches holdout precision hierarchy: GOLDEN > HIGH
   - 35% are GT gaps - ground truth expansion would help here too
