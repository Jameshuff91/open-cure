# Research Loop Progress

## Current Session: h361, h360 (2026-02-05)

### Session Summary

**Agent Role:** Research Executor
**Status:** Complete
**Hypotheses Tested: 2**
- h361: DPP4 Inhibitor Coverage Gap Investigation - **VALIDATED** (measurement artifact from stale deliverables)
- h360: Deliverables Regeneration for Latest Rules - **VALIDATED** (regenerated, DPP4 drugs now included)

### KEY SESSION FINDINGS

#### h361: DPP4 Coverage Gap Investigation - VALIDATED

**Hypothesis:** Why do DPP4 inhibitors have only 5.3% coverage (worst of any drug class)?

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. DPP4 drugs **ARE in DRKG** by DrugBank ID (DB01261, DB06335, etc.) with 600-1700 edges each
2. DPP4 drugs **ARE in Ground Truth** with proper name→DrugBank mapping
3. DPP4 drugs **ARE in embeddings** as drkg:Compound::DB...
4. Live predictor **DOES return** Sitagliptin, Saxagliptin at GOLDEN tier for T2DM

**Actual Cause:** The deliverables file was STALE - generated by old script without production_predictor rules

**Impact:** All "coverage gap" measurements against old deliverables were measuring OUTDATED data

#### h360: Deliverables Regeneration - VALIDATED

**Action:** Regenerated deliverables using production_predictor with all h273-h360 rules

**Key Changes:**
| Metric | Old | New |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Total predictions | 13,461 | 7,131 |
| GOLDEN tier | 0 | 1,946 |
| HIGH tier | 3,288 | 777 |
| MEDIUM tier | 7,078 | 2,658 |
| LOW tier | 3,050 | 1,750 |

**DPP4 in T2DM:**
- Old: NO DPP4 drugs
- New: Sitagliptin (GOLDEN), Saxagliptin (GOLDEN)

**Root Cause of Reduction:** Production_predictor has many more filtering rules than old generate_production_deliverable.py:
- Mechanism-specific disease filter
- Domain isolation filter
- Base-to-complication filter
- Broad class isolation filter
- Cancer-only drug filter
- Many others (h273-h360)

### New Hypotheses Generated
- h363: SGLT2 and modern diabetes drug coverage (check if same artifact)
- h364: Tier distribution validation (confirm precision by tier)
- h365: Prediction count reduction analysis (understand 47% reduction)

### Cumulative Statistics
| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Validated | 227 |
| Invalidated | 69 |
| Inconclusive | 13 |
| Blocked | 21 |
| Deprioritized | 7 |
| Pending | 28 |
| **Total** | **365** |

## Previous Session: h245, h357, h359, h358 (2026-02-05)

### Session Summary

**Agent Role:** Research Executor
**Status:** Complete
**Hypotheses Tested: 4**
- h245: Emerging Treatments Validation - **VALIDATED** (5/9 emerging treatments correctly predicted)
- h357: SGLT2 Inhibitor → HF Gap Analysis - **VALIDATED** (no gap - expected behavior explained)
- h359: Missing Drug Detection via DRKG Coverage - **VALIDATED** (33.5% drug coverage quantified)
- h358: Confidence Calibration by Validation Status - **VALIDATED** (tier ordering correct)

### KEY SESSION FINDINGS

#### h245: Emerging Treatments Validation - VALIDATED

**Hypothesis:** Check if our predictions match recent (2023-2026) FDA approvals/clinical trials

**Validated predictions (5):**
1. Sotatercept → Pulmonary Hypertension (MEDIUM) - FDA approved March 2024
2. Dantrolene → Heart Failure/VT - 2025 RCT shows 66% VT reduction
3. Landiolol → Cardiac Arrhythmias (LOW) - FDA approved for SVT
4. Canagliflozin → Heart Failure (HIGH) - SGLT2 class approved for HF
5. Evolocumab → Atherosclerosis (HIGH) - VESALIUS-CV 2024 expansion

**Missed predictions (4):**
- Finerenone → HF (drug not in predictions)
- Aficamten → HCM (new drug not in DRKG)
- Acoramidis → ATTR-CM (not in predictions)
- Empagliflozin → HF (model gap despite 11 predictions)

**Result:** 55% success rate for drugs in DRKG. Gap is due to newer drugs not in DRKG.

#### h357: SGLT2 Inhibitor → HF Gap Analysis - VALIDATED

**Investigation:** Why doesn't Empagliflozin predict heart failure?

**Findings:**
1. SGLT2 inhibitors ARE in DRKG with good connectivity (1400-1900 edges)
2. Heart failure IS in GT for these drugs
3. Canagliflozin → chronic HF IS predicted (HIGH, is_known=True)
4. The "gap" is EXPECTED: HF is known indication, correctly filtered

**Conclusion:** No gap - novel predictions filter known indications correctly.

#### h359: Missing Drug Detection via DRKG Coverage - VALIDATED

**Quantified coverage gap:**
- Total GT drugs: 2,367
- Drugs WITH predictions: 793 (33.5%)
- Drugs WITHOUT predictions: 1,574 (66.5%)

**Coverage by drug type (best to worst):**
| Drug Type | Coverage | Missing |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Fusion proteins | 87.5% | 1 |
| Statins | 81.8% | 2 |
| ACE inhibitors | 77.8% | 2 |
| Monoclonal antibodies | 54.5% | 66 |
| Kinase inhibitors | 34.9% | 56 |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | 26.3% | 14 |
| DPP4 inhibitors | 5.3% | 18 |

**Root causes:** DRKG built ~2020 (misses newer drugs), biologics naming conventions differ, combination products missing.

#### h358: Confidence Calibration by Validation Status - VALIDATED

**Analysis:** Are confidence tiers well-calibrated for predicting validation?

**Known indication rate by tier:**
| Tier | Known Rate | Expected Precision |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| HIGH | 15.0% | 20.9% |
| MEDIUM | 7.2% | 14.3% |
| LOW | 1.5% | 6.4% |

**Key findings:**
- Tier ordering is correct: HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
- Absolute rates differ due to methodology (exact vs fuzzy matching)
- Landiolol case: FDA-approved drug in LOW tier due to sparse DRKG data
- LOW tier may contain valid but data-sparse drugs

### New Hypotheses Generated
- h357-h362: SGLT2 gap, calibration, coverage, regeneration, DPP4, sparse rescue

### Cumulative Statistics
| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Validated | 225 |
| Invalidated | 69 |
| Inconclusive | 13 |
| Blocked | 21 |
| Deprioritized | 7 |
| Pending | 27 |
| **Total** | **362** |
| Deprioritized | 7 |
| Pending | 27 |
| **Total** | **361**
