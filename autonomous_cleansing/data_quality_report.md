## Cleansing Transformations Applied

1. **Entity Type Normalization** (Task 1)
   - Merged 22 entity types into 14 standardized PascalCase types
   - Examples: `drug` + `Drug` → `Drug`, `gene/protein` + `Gene` → `Gene`

2. **Drug Name Resolution** (Task 3)
   - Resolved 8,413 DrugBank IDs to actual drug names
   - Added `drugbank_id` column to preserve original IDs
   - Resolution rate: 34.6% (limited by open data availability)

3. **Gene Symbol Resolution** (Task 4)
   - Resolved 20,763 gene IDs to HGNC symbols
   - Added `ncbi_gene_id` column to preserve original IDs
   - Resolution rate: 56.4% (79% of genes now have proper names)

4. **Relation Normalization** (Tasks 5-6)
   - Mapped 153 original relation types to 99 standardized relations
   - Removed source prefixes (Hetionet::, DRUGBANK::, etc.)
   - Preserved original relations in `relation_original` column

## Data Integrity Validation

All validation checks passed:
- ✓ All 273,581 node IDs are unique
- ✓ All required fields (id, type, name) have values
- ✓ All 16,224,956 edges reference valid nodes
- ✓ No orphaned edges detected

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Additional Drug Name Sources**: Consider integrating PubChem, ChEMBL for better drug resolution
2. **Gene ID Sources**: Add mappings from Ensembl for non-NCBI genes
3. **Entity Deduplication**: Identify and merge duplicate entities across sources
4. **External ID Enrichment**: Add MONDO, DOID mappings for diseases
